Improving Image Search - Quality
================================
- Use Flickr Groups API to find images with a certain style suited for stock-image backgrounds.
	- make multiple flickr.photo.search queries, with different group_ids.
	- high quality groups can be found in /misc/flickrgroups.md

Improving Image Search - Relevancy
==================================
- For TextTags with underscores, parse them (i.e. startups_and_entrepreneurship -> startups, entrepreneurship)
- TFIDF for more specific search terms in addition to textTags
- Synonyms of Text Tags for Search

Showing off more Indico Capabilities
====================================
- Sentiment to inspire color gradient backgrounds in a post
